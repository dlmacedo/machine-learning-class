# Machine Learning and Deep Learning

The code of this repository should be used to perform the practical classes and the recommended tasks. The environment should have Python 3.X, and PyTorch 1.X. We recommend installing additional packages using conda or pip. All notebooks of this repository are already configured to run on Google Colab using GPU support for Deep Learning. Bellow we present some usefull links.
